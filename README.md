### Welcome to tNether a custom Nether Generator

This plugin will allow you to generate a semi-vanilla like Nether, preferable with the
red skybox if you know what I mean. When this plugin is somewhat a real thing then it will
hopefully contain the new biomes. Probably no mobs tho.

**This plugin is currently not working with the latest API, it current state allows
it to run on API 3.0.0**
